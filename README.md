# School_District_Analysis


### Overview of the school district analysis


The purpose of this analysis was to remove the unreliable data to provide a reliable data set. The inaccurate data was the false grades entered in by the 9th graders at Thomas High. Once all the faulty data was removed, the analysis was performed again to provide accurate results. The analysis includes a total district analysis, a school summary analysis, the top five highest schools, the bottom five lowest schools, score averages by grade levels, scores by average spending per student, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 

#### How is the district summary affected?

#### Thomas High School Ninth Grade Replacement Results 
o The math and reading scores both improved after the ninth-grade scores were raised.

o As Thomas High’s grades were corrected and consequently raised, this raised the averages for all the criteria in which their scores were included to determine the mean. This includes the $630 to $639 **spending range scores** found in the scores by School Size Analysis, the 1,000 to 1,999 **school size scores** found in the School Size Analysis, and the **charter school scores** found in the School Type Analysis. 

#### Summary:

After the ninth grade scores at Thomas High were replaced with “NaN”, the district scores increased, Thomas High was among the top five schools based on score performance, the charter school average scores increased, and the average score performance of school sizes ranging between 1,000 and 1,999 increased.
